  <h1>Steak</h1>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Here’s how to cook steak like a chef – pan seared and basted with garlic thyme butter! It’s dramatic, simple cooking at its best, you’ll look like a total pro and feel like you’re dining at the best steakhouse in town</p>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Thickish cut steak – no more than 2.5cm/1″ thick, because we want to cook this entirely on the stove (thicker cuts need to be finished in the oven).</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Fresh thyme</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring to room temp! This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for the very centre to be cooked to your liking</li>
    <li>Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks</li>
    <li>Get your skillet SMOKING HOT before putting the steak in – again, for the crust</li>
    <li>WARNING: The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!</li>
    <li>Take the steak off the stove BEFORE your desired internal temperature (see chart below) because the internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests; and</li>
    <li>REST your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!</li>
  </ol>
